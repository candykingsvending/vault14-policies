    <h1>Vault 14 - Legal Policies</h1>

    <h2>Copyright & Company Information</h2>
    <p>Vault 14 operates as a DBA (Doing Business As) trade name of Candy Kings Vending, LLC. All artifacts, sales, and operations are managed under Candy Kings Vending, LLC, with machine maintenance and vending operations handled through its standard procedures.</p>
    <p>All content, designs, and products associated with Vault 14 are protected under copyright and trademark laws. Unauthorized reproduction, distribution, or use of any materials without permission is strictly prohibited.</p>

    <h2>Shipping Policy</h2>
    <p>Due to the one-of-a-kind nature of Vault 14â€™s artifacts and collectibles, all sales are final.</p>
    <p>Once an order has been shipped, Vault 14 is not responsible for any lost, stolen, or damaged packages. However, if an issue arises, we will assist in connecting you with the shipping carrier, who may be able to provide support.</p>
    <p>Shipping times and costs vary depending on location, item weight, and carrier availability. Customers will receive tracking details once their order is dispatched.</p>

    <h2>Return & Replacement Policy</h2>
    <p>Because our items are unique, rare, and often irreplaceable, we do not offer returns, replacements, or exchanges. All purchases are final.</p>
    <p>For any concerns about shipping or product issues, we recommend reaching out to the shipping carrier directly. If needed, Vault 14 can assist in providing carrier details.</p>

    <h2>Our Commitment to Security & Data Privacy</h2>
    <p>We understand that our clients value privacy and security, especially when it comes to personal contact information and order details. Because of this, we take extensive measures to protect your data.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Secure Systems:</strong> Our databases use up-to-date security measures, and we intentionally limit the number of systems handling order information to no more than four locations at any given time.</li>
        <li><strong>Trusted Partners:</strong> When working with suppliers or shipping partners, we verify that they do not sell or share data outside of their company.</li>
        <li><strong>Rapid Response:</strong> In the rare event of a security issue, we will act swiftly and notify affected clients immediately.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Your privacy and security are our top priorities, and we continuously strive to maintain the highest standards of protection.</p>
